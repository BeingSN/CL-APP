## Overview

This is a web app featuring information abouot the 2019/20 season of the UEFA Champions League. I wanted to build on my learning of the MERN stack as well as handling data from third-party APIs. Lastly, it is interactive in the way that users can input their score predictions.

It was built using the MERN stack: Node.js (Express) backend, React frontend, MongoDB database. Because I wanted to focus on the front-end, the backend is simply for fetching API data from outer sources and to run a simple database containing statistics and team facts, etc..</p>

### Sources

Content/data from: [uefa](https://uefa.com); [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League); [football-data.org](https://football-data.org)
and mock data.

The visual layout was inspired by [it's nice that](https://itsnicethat.com) and [https://bureau-va.com/](https://bureau-va.com/).

### Additional features

Some features that I plan to build on in the near future:

- user can build own squad (with real players)
- user authentication
